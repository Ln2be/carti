# maouja_carti (Expo)

This repository was initialized with Expo (blank template).

## Quick start

Prerequisites:
- Node.js (16+ recommended)
- npm or yarn
- For device testing: Expo Go (iOS/Android) or an Android emulator / iOS Simulator

To start the dev server (Metro bundler):

- Start (LAN):

```bash
cd /home/elhassen/Desktop/maouja_carti
npm run start -- --lan
```

- Start (tunnel, requires ngrok):

```bash
npm run start -- --tunnel
```

Note: the first time using `--tunnel` you may be prompted to install `@expo/ngrok`. If you prefer to avoid that prompt, use `--lan` or `--localhost`.

To run on Android device/emulator:

```bash
npm run android
```

To run on iOS (macOS only):

```bash
npm run ios
```

To run on web:

```bash
npm run web
```

## Files created
- `App.js` — entry UI component (default blank Expo app)
- `package.json` — scripts and dependencies
- `app.json` — Expo config

## Notes
- Initialization logged some npm audit warnings/vulnerabilities and deprecated package warnings. These are common for scaffolded projects; you can run `npm audit` and `npm audit fix` to see what's fixable.
- If the dev server asks to install `@expo/ngrok` and you want to use tunnels, accept the install or preinstall it with `npm i -D @expo/ngrok`.

## Next steps (optional)
- Add TypeScript: follow Expo docs to convert to TS
- Add navigation: install `@react-navigation/native`
- Add testing: add Jest + React Native Testing Library

Generated by assistant to scaffold the new Expo app.
